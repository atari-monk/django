# LinkShelf

That sounds like a great project! A **LinkShelf** app will help you practice key Django concepts like models, views, authentication, and APIs. Here’s a breakdown of how you can structure your project:  

---

### 🚀 **Features for LinkShelf**
1. **User Authentication** – Sign up, log in, log out.  
2. **Link Management**  
   - Add, edit, delete links  
   - Categorize links into folders or tags  
   - Mark links as favorites  
3. **Search & Filtering**  
   - Search links by title, description, or URL  
   - Filter by category or tags  
4. **Public/Private Links**  
   - Users can set links as **private** or **public**  
   - Public links can be shared with others  
5. **API Support** (Optional)  
   - Allow users to access their links via REST API  
6. **Import & Export**  
   - Upload a CSV file of links  
   - Export collected links  
7. **Bookmarklet/Extension (Bonus Feature)**  
   - A small script to quickly save links from any website

### 🏗 **Tech Stack**
- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework (if making an API)  
- **Frontend:** Django templates (or React if you want to practice frontend)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or SQLite (for simplicity)  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap  
- **Extras:** Celery (for background tasks like scraping link metadata)

### 🛠 **Project Structure (Django Apps)**
```
linkshelf/
│── manage.py
│── db.sqlite3
│── .env  (for secrets)
│── linkshelf/  (Main project)
│── users/  (Authentication & user management)
│── links/  (Link storage, categories, tags)
│── templates/  (HTML files)
│── static/  (CSS, JS, Images)
```
Each app (users, links) will have its own `models.py`, `views.py`, `urls.py`, etc.

---

### 🔥 **Next Steps**
1. **Set up Django & create project:**  
   ```bash
   django-admin startproject linkshelf
   cd linkshelf
   python manage.py startapp users
   python manage.py startapp links
   ```
2. **Define your models:** Start with `Link`, `Category`, and `UserProfile`  
3. **Create views and templates** for adding, viewing, and managing links  
4. **Implement authentication** (Django’s built-in auth system)  
5. **Style the frontend** and add JavaScript interactivity  
6. **Deploy** on **Render/Heroku/Vercel** when ready 🎉
